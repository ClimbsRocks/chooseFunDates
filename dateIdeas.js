        description: 'Enter the movies. Buy tub of endless popcorn. Watch movie. Surreptitiously (you know, with the high-knee walking, hunched back, and cackling laughter) sneack into the next film. Refill popcorn. Repeat. Make sure to go to a new popcorn counter each time. Wear boring clothes. Pass out in a butter-drenched haze of explosions and implausibly perfect relationships. Savor your own imperfect match even more.'

        description: 'Have one person pick up a smorgasboard of their favorite guacamoles. Bonus combinations come from picking up an equally large array of favorite things to dip in guacamole (be careful- carrots are contentious, chocolate-dipped bacon will get you creativity points, and your date\'s toe will quickly establish whether they share your foot fetish or not).'

Bring flavors that would be at home in a crazy donut shop, a farmers market, or the latest hipster haunt. Compare batches, tournament style. Make up crazy names for each flavor combination you conjure up. Picture world domination and population-wide health improvements through running a chain of artisanal popcorn shops.'

        description: 'Tour around to all your local ice cream & gelato favorites. Get a taster spoon of all the good-looking flavors. For extra weirdness points, blindfold one person. To avoid burning out too early, only sample flavors at each place- don\'t actually buy any ice cream. Tip super generously. Giggle tremendously while running out so that all other customers assume you two hooligans are surely up to no good.'
